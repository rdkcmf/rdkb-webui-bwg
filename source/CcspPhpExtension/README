COSA EXTENSION FOR PHP5
=======================

This is a PHP5 extension (written in C) that provides access to the underlying
CCSP Data Model via CCSP message bus.


ABOUT THE PHP EXTENSION API
===========================

The details of PHP extension API design can be found in the document "CCSP Common Component Software Architecture Specification - CCSP Web UI Component" (CCSP_GW_Web_UI_Compoent_Spec.docx)

Following functions are provided in the PHP extensions that PHP code can call,
though it is encouraged to call the PHP APIs provided from ccspdm.php:

1. DmExtGetStrsWithRootObj
2. DmExtSetStrsWithRootObj
3. DmExtGetInstanceIds
4. addTblObj
5. delTblObj
6. getStr           - obsoleted by DmExtGetStrsWithRootObj
7. setStr           - obsoleted by DmExtSetStrsWithRootObj
8. getInstanceIds   - obsoleted by DmExtGetInstanceIds


DEBUGGING
=========

To turn debugging log on, touch "/tmp/cosa_php_debug", then restart PHP extension (restart web server)

The debug trace is logged in the file "/var/log/cosa_php_ext.log"


BUILD INDEPENDENTLY ON PC SIMULATION
====================================

Do this from a bash prompt -

    cd source/CcspPhpExtension
    phpize
    ./configure --enable-cosa
    make

The 'phpize' executable can be found in your distribution's PHP development package
    "sudo apt-get install php5-dev" for Ubuntu
    "sudo yum install php-devel" for Fedora

This will build the PHP extension and produce a binary modules/cosa.so.

Add this binary to the php.ini [extensions] section -

    extension_dir = "/fss/gw/usr/ccsp"
    extension=cosa.so

Touch this file, "/tmp/cosa_php_pcsim"

Finally restart the web server.

    sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
